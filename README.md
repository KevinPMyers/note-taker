# Note-Taker

## Objective
To build a note taking application to demonstrate knowledge of Express.js and back-end knowledge.
This app, upon opening, should take you to a landing page with a link to your notes page.
When the notes page link is clicked, the user is then presented with exisiting notes on the left hand side, with the option to create a new note, or delete old ones.
Once the user clicks to add a new note, a save icon will appear in the navigation at the top of the page,
once that save icon is clicked, the note is saved and appears in the left hand column with the other saved notes.
When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
Then that note appears in the right-hand column
When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
Then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column
